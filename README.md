## Help and Support

Please do not email me for support or help with this plugin, use the issue tracker link above, so everyone will benefit from community questions and involvement, and I don't have to answer the same questions over and over for many individuals.

This is a Cordova plugin, firstly. You should be familiar with the Cordova plugin system before you try to use this plugin. Fortunately, it's pretty straight forward and easy to understand.

You can [read more about Android plugin development for Cordova here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/plugin.html).  Knowledge of all of these internals is not necessary, but it doesn't hurt to be familiar either. 

Read here to [learn how to use Cordova Plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#add-plugins).

If you still have questions, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MenelicSoftware/cordova-plugin-brother-label-printer.git/issues). Please look at existing issues, and if your question is not answered yet, feel free to open a new issue and I'm happy to assist.

```

__Tested models:__ `PT-E550W`

(if you have tried this with other models, please update this list and send a pull request)

__NOTE:__ Currently, you will need to adjust the `modelName` variable in `src/android/BrotherPrinter.java`. It is the first variable in the `BrotherPrinter` class. This could be extended to be configured through config.xml or via a JS call, but it's currently hard-coded. Feel free to send a pull request to make the configuration more extensible... 


## Supported interfaces (by this plugin):
```
Wi-Fi/Wired Ethernet (tested)
BlueTooth?
USB?
```

_The SDK also has Bluetooth support, but this is not integrated currently. Pull requests are welcomed..._

## Usage

See here for JS interfaces to the plugin: `www/printer.js`

There is a single available method...

```
printLabel(base64ImageOrPdfToPrint, {"numberOfCopies":1, "orientation":"LANDSCAPE", "labelName":"W62RB", "modelName":"QL-820NBW", "port":"NET"})

```
For the meaning of each of these parameters, please see http://www.brother.com/product/dev/mobile/android/index.htm


Currently, the last printer that is found will be the one targetted due to the way we're looping over the `netPrinters` array. This plugin could be extended to allow the user to select which printer they want to connect with... If this is desired, let me know, and I'll address when I get a chance, or better yet, send a pull request. The best way would either be to pass the printer IP/MAC to the printViaSDK method, or perhaps you could just pass an index to select the desired printer from the `netPrinters` list.

__sendUSBConfig__ calls the Brother SDK's `printFile` method. The expected input is a string containing raw print commands, which is written to a temporary file in the app cache directory, and is then sent to the `printFile` method and deleted afterwards. You will need a device that supports USB-OTG and a USB-OTG cable. On first run the app will request USB permissions, and it should be saved after that for subsequent prints. As-is, this method is used to send raw commands in PCL (Printer Control Language) to the printer... For example, to configure the network settings of the printer, etc... You will need to reach out to Brother for documentation of the PCL commands. You can probably find them by searching for "[Brother Printer Command Reference](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Brother+Printer+Command+Reference)" and appending your model number. This method could be extended easily to accept other types of file input, so you could, for example, print JPG images, etc...
